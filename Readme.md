WinBGIm 64 bit

Solution for graphics.h libbgi error

This build of libbgi.a is compatible with 64 bit compiler.
Which means you can link against it without linker error or 
where linker says it can't find libbgi.a cause 64 bit compiler 
ignores 32 bit build of the library.


Win32 system calls have been updated to reflect the changes in win32 api for 64 bit compatibility.
